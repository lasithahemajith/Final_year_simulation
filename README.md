Cooperative Vehicular Communication using WiFi

According to the project scope first we chose the single side highway scenario. In this each vehicle maintains a uniform gap between front and rear vehicle with constant speed. Gap of the vehicles depends on creation time durations of the vehicle nodes. So it will generate different vehicle densities.
